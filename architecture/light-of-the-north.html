<h1>Residential Project, Light of the North, Shenyang</h1>
<p>Light of the North(北宸之光) is located at the intersection of Hong, Shenbei, and Huanggu districts, close to the University City, with a developing residential atmosphere. To the north is the city's main road, Zhengliang First Road, and the street layout presents a new urban image. Serving as the community's interface with the city, the project adopts the "folding fan," a symbol of traditional culture, as a design element. The structure unfolds along an overall curved surface, with the building's wings expanding outward in a grand manner. A 7-meter overhanging canopy gradually rolls up from inside to outside, accompanied by an exquisite grid lighting design, covering the parking space at the entrance completely. This design ensures that residents can enter the park without being affected by rain or wind, with an open posture and warm lighting..</p>
