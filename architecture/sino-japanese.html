The Sino-Japanese Industrial Park of Shenyang is a PPP (Public Private Partnership) project designed to attract investment from Japan. It offers amenities including catering, recreational, and administrative services to business tenants. The structure, while modern, incorporates Japanese symbolism and inheres its dense traditional urban fabric, enhancing its appeal to prospective investors.<br>
