    <p>The study deals with two problems:</p>
    

    <h3>1. The Traffic Pattern in the Grids</h3>
    <p>Firstly, it simulates the spontaneous traffic patterns emerging within the grid, the value creation and growth patterns that arise in response to the spontaneous movements of inhabitants.</p>

    <h3>2. The Erosion of the Grids</h3>
    <p>Secondly, it delves into the grid's deterioration due to factors such as economic downturns or sociopolitical upheavals, highlighting the subsequent movement reorganization. Notably, informal occupations following these disturbances play a pivotal role in reshaping the city.</p>

    <h3 id="installation">Installation and Usage</h3>
    <p>No installation is required. The code is hosted on GitHub Pages at <a href="https://github.com/ludwigpeking/grid-erosion.git/">https://github.com/ludwigpeking/grid-erosion.git</a>. 
    p5*js library is used in the project. The library is included in the project. The application can be run by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
    From the index page, users have access to the scenes and descriptions.<br>
    <h3>Parameters of the grid that can be changed in the scenes:</h3>

    <ul>
    
      <li>Street Count: Number of streets (integer)</li>
      <li>Avenue Count: Number of avenues  (integer)</li>
      <li>Street Width: Width of the streets (integer)</li>
      <li>Block Parcel Count: Number of parcels in a block (integer)</li>
      <li>Parcel Width: Width of a parcel (integer)</li>
      <li>Parcel Depth: Depth of a parcel (integer)</li>
      <li>Res: the resolution or the size of the tile that affects only viewing</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Growth events</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Add traffic and create prosperity to the grid</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Decline events</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Parcels destroyed randomly</li>
    <li>Parcels with low prosperity becomes vacant</li>
    <li>Overall prosperity declines </li>
    <li>Overall traffic volume  declines </li>


  </ul>
  <h3>Claimation events - spontaneous growth after the age of turmoil</h3>
  <ul>
    <li> New users spawning at desirable location</li>
    <li> Properties claim space from open space of no owner</li>
  </ul>
