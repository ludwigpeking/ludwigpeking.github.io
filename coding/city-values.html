    Diagrams above: 1) Perlin noise generated map, trade route from pathfinding
    with topographical costs, locations of settlements decided by individual
    owners based on their preference; 2) The value grid of security, generated
    by the presence of warriors (the castle) and the natural surveillance
    provided by other inhabitants.

  <h3>Self-organization of settlement based on Value Grid system</h3>
  <p>
    This study demonstrates value grid based procedural town map generation.
    Each individual, based on their own profession and interest, weights the
    value grid differently, therefore will have a different choice of location
    for settlement. For example, a warrior/lord eyes on a location with
    defensible terrain; a farmer picks where land is abundant and mutual
    protection is provided by neighborhood; a merchant looks at the amount of
    foot traffic. Professions/Castes and their interest value
  </p>
  <li>
    lord/warrior/protector: defensible terrain, secured fresh water access, ...
  </li>
  <li>
    farmer/tenant: more available arable land (per capita) in manageable
    distance, protector in reachable distance, natural surveillance provided by
    the neighborhood
  </li>
  <li>
    Trader: enough foot traffic pass by to sustain business, protector in
    reachable distance, natural surveillance provided by the neighborhood, â€¦
  </li>
  <p>
    An action made by an individual changes the values. All together, they
    demonstrate a self-organized pattern based on individual choice.

    implement to the project.
