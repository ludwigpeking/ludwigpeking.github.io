<p>Shoin-zukuri (書院造) is a style of Japanese residential architecture. 
This project tests a technique called Wave Function Collapse algorithm, originated by Maxim Gumin @ExUtumno @OskSta , to generate building complexes of Shoin-zukuri style.
This project is able to create infinite and surprising architectural composition and interior space with limited building blocks. The connection of the building blocks are locally, tectonically bounded, but not constrained by experience or existing precedents.
