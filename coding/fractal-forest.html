<p>This code is a creative implementation of a tree drawing algorithm in JavaScript using the p5.js library. </p>

<h3>Global Variables</h3>
<p>
sizes: An array specifying the canvas width and height.<br>
slider: A UI slider that allows the user to adjust the branching angle of the trees.<br>
angle: The angle by which branches diverge from the trunk and each other.<br>
ran: A random value used in the branching logic.<br>
offscreen: An offscreen canvas that holds the drawn trees. This is used to maintain the tree drawings even when the main canvas is refreshed.<br>
numberOfTree: The number of trees to be drawn on the canvas.<br>
leafCount: A counter for the number of leaves drawn.<br>
redrawButton and treeButton: Buttons for user interactions.<br></p>

<h3>Functions </h3>
<p>preload() Function</p>
<p>Before the main code runs, this function loads an image (the "Sign.png" image) into the <strong>sign</strong> variable.</p>

<p>setup() Function</p>
<p>This function initializes the canvas, the offscreen canvas, and UI elements. It also sets the initial state and draws the trees for the first time.</p>

<p>draw() Function</p>
<p>This function is repeatedly called by p5.js and continuously renders the canvas. It displays the offscreen canvas (with the trees) and the current angle value from the slider.</p>

<p>redrawTree() Function</p>
<p>This function is responsible for drawing trees. It resets the offscreen canvas background, sets the branching angle based on the slider's value, and then draws a specified number of trees. After the trees, it overlays a semi-transparent sign image. The tree trunks change colors based on their position (creating a depth effect).</p>

<p>changeNumTrees() Function</p>
<p>Allows the user to input a new number for the total trees and then redraws the trees.</p>

<p>branch() Function</p>
<p>This is a recursive function that draws a tree branch and its sub-branches. The function considers randomness to vary the angles and lengths of the branches, creating a more natural look. When the branches are small enough, leaves are drawn instead of further branches. The leaves' shapes are defined using the bezierVertex function, which provides a way to draw curves.</p>
